### Points of pride:
* Accessibility-friendly: The game can be played using only the keyboard (no mouse required)
* Modern JavaScript (ES6+): Classes, const/let, fat arrow, template literals, etc.
* Styling: Flexbox and font ems
* Commenting: Uses JSDoc 

### Area of improvement:
* Improve mobile experience by refactoring so that all game elements stay within the device's viewport
